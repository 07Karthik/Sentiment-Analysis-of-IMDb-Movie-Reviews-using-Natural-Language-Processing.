# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDb-Movie-Reviews-using-Natural-Language-Processing.

this project, aims to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of IMDb movie reviews. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. The IMDb movie review dataset contains a collection of text-based movie reviews, and our goal is to automatically classify them into positive and negative sentiment categories.

The project can be broken down into the following key steps:

1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
   - We start by downloading the IMDb movie review dataset from Kaggle and extracting the data.
   - The dataset contains both review text and sentiment labels (e.g., positive or negative).
   - We preprocess the data by removing HTML tags, converting text to lowercase, and removing stopwords, enhancing the quality of the text data.

2. Text Vectorization:
   - We use various NLP techniques to convert the processed text data into numerical representations.
   - This includes word embeddings, where words are transformed into dense vector representations, and these vectors capture semantic meaning.

3. Model Training:
   - We employ machine learning, specifically a logistic regression model, to train a sentiment classifier.
   - The model is trained on the vectorized text data and the associated sentiment labels.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - To assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model, we evaluate its accuracy on a separate test dataset.
   - The accuracy metric tells us how well the model can correctly classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

5. Inference:
   - After successful training and evaluation, the model is ready for practical use.
   - We can input new, unseen movie reviews, and the model will predict their sentiment.

The project provides insights into the sentiment distribution of IMDb movie reviews and enables automatic sentiment classification of reviews, which can be useful for various applications, including recommendation systems, movie analysis, and market research.
